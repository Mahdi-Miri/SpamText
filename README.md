# SpamText
This Python project develops a spam detection model using Naive Bayes. It preprocesses SMS text data, converts it to TF-IDF vectors, and trains a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier. Model performance is evaluated using accuracy and recall metrics.

Key Features:

Data loading and preprocessing (cleaning, stemming, stop word removal).
TF-IDF vectorization.
Multinomial Naive Bayes classification.
Performance evaluation with confusion matrix, accuracy, and recall.
Technologies:

Pandas, NLTK, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.
Use Case:

SMS spam detection.
